# Entity Component System Core

This repository contains the basic sources needed to establish an Entity-Component-System architecture known from Unity3D for the modern web.

So far all documentation and fundamental concepts behind ECS can be taken from the Unity3D website itself: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.1/manual/ecs_core.html
